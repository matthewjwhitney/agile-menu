  <h1>WELCOME TO TRAIL CREST BREWING!</h1>

  <p>
    Since Trail Crest Brewing sources all of its food from local farms and ranches and brews all of its beer in-house, our menu changes frequently! Instead of killing many trees printing hardcopy menus everytime our menu changes, we are one of the first restaurants to utilize a digital menu. When we introduce or run out of a beer or a food item it is added to or removed from the menu in the blink of an eye!	
  </p>
  
  <p>
	For every item on the menu, we provide information on the supplier so you know that you are eating a locally grown, naturally-raised product!
  </p>

  <h4>We would appreciate your feedback!</h4>
