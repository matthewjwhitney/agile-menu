  <h1>OUR INNOVATIVE FOOD PROGRAM</h1>

  <h4>Skilled In-House Processing</h4>
  <p>
  Our entire menu of food products is prepared in-house with the most innovative techniques and technology, using raw materials like produce pulled fresh out of the ground by a family of farmers or a whole animal that lived a healthy life. Intensive techniques like butchery, curing meats, preserving foods, baking breads, making stocks and sauces, etc., that would normally be outsourced for convenience, are routine in our kitchen. 
  </p>
  
  <h4> Dynamic Digital Menu</h4>
  <p>
  Because of our dedication to supporting a healthy local food system, our menu features items that change with availability dictated by seasons and also by limited quantities from small businesses. In order to keep up with these changes and also to save waste from printing, we’ve developed a custom mobile app and will hand our guests a tablet instead of flat paper menus to give them an evolving, content-rich experience. This app also can be downloaded by our guests and can be used as a powerful marketing tool.
  </p>
  
  <h4>Community Education</h4>
  <p>
  With such an innovative approach to our kitchen system, a campaign to inform our guests and employees is key to understanding not only the value of our products but also how they’re making a responsible choice at our restaurant for their health and the health of our community.
  </p>

  <h4>Special Events</h4>
  <p>
  We plan opportunities for our guests to meet the farmers in our community, try ingredients that are rare and exciting, taste foods designed to pair with special beers, learn about food preparation techniques they can employ at home, and have catered private parties at our restaurant with custom menus.
